# Community Detection in Synthetic Networks

This project analyzes the evolution of community structures in synthetic networks as the **internal connection probability (`prr`)** varies. It applies three different **community detection algorithms**:

- **Louvain Method** (Modularity Maximization)
- **Girvan-Newman Algorithm** (Edge Betweenness)
- **Infomap Algorithm** (Flow-based Clustering)

The analysis includes:
âœ… Evolution of the **number of communities** and **modularity**  
âœ… **Comparison with ground-truth partitions** using:  
   - **Jaccard Index**
   - **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)**
   - **Normalized Variation of Information (NVI)**  
âœ… **Visualization** of communities at key values of `prr` (`0.02`, `0.16`, `1.00`)
